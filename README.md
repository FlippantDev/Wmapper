## How To Use [outdated] [before 1.0.3]

### -------> Default Mode <-------------------------
 - Type 'Create' on the Enter a command prompt
 - Enter key you want to assign for the click, for example If I want key W to simulate a click somewhere, I'll choose W
 - If you type Q in that prompt it won't quit the app but instead finalize the config you made
 - Once done choosing a key, move your cursor to a place on your screen and click S on keyboard, This place is where the click will be simulated
 - Once cords are saved, It will prompt to Enter another key for next click
 - You can either make more or type q and finalize it
 - Once finalized, test it out by pressing on the key you chose, In this example it was W

### -------> Swiping Mode <-------------------------
 - Type 'Create' on the Enter a command prompt
 - Enter key you want to assign for the click, this will be the key which when pressed, simulates a swipe from start location to end
 - If you type Q in that prompt it won't quit the app but instead finalize the config you made
 - Once done choosing a key, move your cursor to a place on your screen and click S on keyboard, This will be the start location for swipe
 - Once cords are saved, It will prompt you to enter what type of swipe you want
 - Choose one [ex. up,down,left,right]
 - It will now prompt you to enter a radius for the swipe
 - The radius is basically the distance from the starting point to another point, For example, If my cords are [x,y] It will add a radius of in this example I'll use 200, It will add 200 to the cords to find end point.
 - A radius of 200 is recommended by the way
 - Now you are going to enter the speed, This will be the duration it takes for your cursor to swipe from Point A to Point B
 - A speed of 0 seconds is recommended for no delay
 - Once done, It will prompt to enter another key for another swipe
 - You can either make more or type q and finalize it
 - Once finalized, test it out by pressing on the key you chose, It should now swipe from your starting point to another point which is the added radius point

### -------> ImportConfig Command <-------------------------
 - Import config is a new feature introduced in 1.0.1, it let's users directly import their keymap config from the directory without having to create keymaps all over again
 - To import a keymap configuration you can use the 'importconfig' command
 - Type 'importconfig' followed by a json file name with content inside
 - The JSON config should be in the same directory as what you are using:

 - So now I will type 'importconfig keymapconfigdemo.json'
 - The JSON file in the photo is already premade for use, you can edit it if you want
 - Once you type it in and enter, it will register and the program will start listening


> **Note**
> This may not apply to future versions so I will try to keep this documentation updated for next versions
